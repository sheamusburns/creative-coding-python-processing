# Write a processing sketch that includes a custom Wall class, 
# moves a small rectangle to the left of the screen until it 
# hits the edge of the window and then heads in the other direction 
# (right) until it hits the other side. It should continue bouncing
# back and forth at the same velocity. 
#
# When the user hits the right right arrow key, 
# make the rectangle move to the right. When it hits the left 
# arrow key, make it move to the left. 
#
# Your code should at least have a setup() function definition, 
# a draw() function definition, and a Wall class definition.
#
# The Wall class should contain attributes and methods that you 
# can call in the draw function (and in other methods) -- I know 
# this sounds confusing but break it down into small pieces.  
#
# Extension: translate location and velocity into PVector objects.
