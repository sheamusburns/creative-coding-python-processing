# Challenges

Each week there will be a number of challenges available that will build on and help you refine your knowledge and skills of elementary concepts.

0. Transforming Data

	- This challenge deals with the `list`, `tuple`, and `class` data types in Python. Solutions that demonstrate deep understanding will make use of the `for` loop to iterate through a list, make use of `list` methods, including `append()`, and will include writing a custom `Person` class.
