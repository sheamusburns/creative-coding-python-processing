# Challenges

Each week there will be a number of challenges available that will build on and help you refine your knowledge and skills of elementary concepts.

0. Transforming Data

	- This challenge deals with the `list`, `tuple`, and `class` data types in Python. Solutions that demonstrate deep understanding will make use of the `for` loop to iterate through a list, make use of `list` methods, including `append()`, and will include writing a custom `Person` class.

	- <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sheamusburns/creative-coding-python-processing/master/challenges/transforming_data__lists_tuples_and_classes.ipynb" download>download challenge file</a> then open in jupyter notebook

1. Writing a class in a Processing sketch.

	- This challenge levels you up in Processing. By using classes, we can have more control over elements on our canvas. Go ahead and try to build a moving wall using a `Wall` class in a new Processing sketch. 

	- Need a boost? Read ch. 10 (pp 129-140) in Make: Getting Started with Processing.py (the yellow book). It's all about using classes to create objects in Processing.

	- copy the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sheamusburns/creative-coding-python-processing/master/challenges/wall_class_challenge.py">challenge instructions</a> into a new processing sketch.
