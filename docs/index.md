# Challenges

There will be a number of challenges available that will build on and help you refine your knowledge and skills of elementary concepts in both Python and Processing.

0. Transforming Data

	- This challenge deals with the `list`, `tuple`, and `class` data types in Python. Solutions that demonstrate deep understanding will make use of the `for` loop to iterate through a list, make use of `list` methods, including `append()`, and will include writing a custom `Person` class.

	- <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sheamusburns/creative-coding-python-processing/master/challenges/transforming_data__lists_tuples_and_classes.ipynb" download>download challenge file</a> then open in jupyter notebook

1. Writing a class in a Processing sketch.

	- This challenge levels you up in Processing. By using classes, we can have more control over elements on our canvas. Go ahead and try to build a moving wall using a `Wall` class in a new Processing sketch. 

	- Need a boost? Read ch. 10 (pp 129-140) in Make: Getting Started with Processing.py (the yellow book). It's all about using classes to create objects in Processing.

	- copy the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sheamusburns/creative-coding-python-processing/master/challenges/wall_class_challenge.py">challenge instructions</a> into a new processing sketch.

2. Art Art Art

	- This challenge is about creativity, independence, and resourcefulness. By now you've learned a bunch of tools in the Processing library. For this challenge you need to create two pieces of digital art using what you've learned so far. The result can be moving-image or still, it can be colorful or not, it can be responsive to the user or static. The only requirement is that each piece of art must include some new feature of Processing that you haven't used before and that you must learn in order to do it. It can be anything from the library that you want, but you must be able to explain the feature/tool afterward. Hint - you will teach everyone one of these features.  

	- Need some inspiration? Search the web for processing images to get an idea what's possible. Hint -- so much is possible. Flip through the yellow book to find a feature you haven't learned about yet, or read through the docs on py.processing.org. 

	- You have only one restriction -- and that's integrity -- you shouldn't copy or take code that was written by someone else. Programming is problem solving, and you need to think through the problems you encounter to get the results you desire. Sometimes it helps to understand how someone else would solve a problem, so I encourage you to talk with each other and read through examples, but don't just take someone else's code and pass it off as your own.  

3. Collisions

	- Recently you learned how to create a collision. Can you create a window where two objects float around at random and know when they collide with each other?
